This example demonstrates the usage of the FeatureGrid with a remote feature
source (`WFS GetFeature`) including remote paging, sorting and filtering.

Sorting and filtering is enabled for the column `name`. To sort the current
features in the table (and so the current features in the map) just press one of
the sorter icons for sorting ascending (arrow up) or descending (arrow down). To
filter the features open the filter menu by clicking on the filter icon and enter
a text to filter the featers by, e.g. `Westfalen`. To reset the filtering start
a new search with no input text.
