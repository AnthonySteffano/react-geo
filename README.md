`react-geo` is a JavaScript library providing a large number of components to build modern mapping applications. It is used in combination with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers) and [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design).

## Installation

```javascript static
npm i --save @terrestris/react-geo
```

## Usage

For a full list of available components, their properties and examples see [here](https://terrestris.github.io/react-geo/docs/latest/index.html).

### TypeScript

The `react-geo` package includes TypeScript declarations as `*.d.ts` files.

### Webpack

If you're using [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) as bundler you need to configure a [less-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/less-loader) inside your webpack-config to enable `react-geo` specific styling (see [here](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) for further details):

```javascript static
module: {
  rules: [{
    test: /\.less|\.css$/,
    loaders: [{
      loader: 'style-loader'
    }, {
      loader: 'css-loader',
    }, {
      loader: 'less-loader',
      options: {
        lessOptions: {
          modifyVars: {
            // Your less variable overridesâ€¦
          },
          javascriptEnabled: true
        }
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```
